Using the real world dataset from the year of 2004

🌍 AI-Powered Air Quality Prediction System
📖 Project Overview
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to predict air quality based on environmental data. Using a Random Forest-based model, it provides accurate predictions, sorting features, and interactive visualizations to help monitor and analyze air quality conditions effectively. The system integrates advanced preprocessing, model training, and visualization tools, enabling reliable insights for environmental monitoring and decision-making.

💡 Features
Accurate Predictions: Utilizes a Random Forest model for reliable air quality forecasting.
Data Preprocessing: Cleanses and transforms raw environmental data for optimal model performance.
Sorting & Visualization: Enables interactive data exploration and insights through advanced visualization tools (e.g., graphs and heatmaps).
Scalable and Modular: Built with scalability and reusability in mind for future environmental AI applications.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks:
Pandas
NumPy
